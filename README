An Gramadoir is a command line
grammar checking engine for 
minority languages.  It is fully
implemented for Irish (Gaelic) at the
moment with some other languages
in the works.  See
http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/
for more information.  

This plugin provides a split screen
interface to the grammar checker,
with the text you are editing on top
and a buffer containing the errors
output by An Gramadoir below.

Pressing <Leader>g once runs
the grammar checker and opens
the error buffer.  Each successive
use of <Leader>g moves the buffers to
the next error, in parallel.  Syntax 
highlighting shows the erroneous text 
in red.  

Pressing <Leader>a stops the grammar
checker and returns to normal editing.
